## Create a pull request

Contributing is simple. If you're new to github simply read this guide on to create a pull request:

https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

There are other guides around on the net as well, for example this one:

https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github

Then just fork this repository, make your changes, and create a pull request. I'll happily accept it.

If you don't want to, or can't for whatever reason, creating an issue with whatever changes you want is also acceptable.

## Other stuff

It's very useful if you archive the websites you find, either with [archive.org](https://archive.org) or [https://archive.is](archive.is) 
or any other good website archival sites, but I'm not going to force you. 
We'll also need an archive link as proof that a site existed to be able to add it to rip in pepperoni.

When you contribute you automatically agree to 

- The CC0 license terms
- Further distribute your changes under the CC0 license

## What's a booru?

In essence, a booru is just a website where one can post images and add tags to said images.
I'm willing to classify any site that have these two features as a booru. 
This means sites like Zerochan, which doesn't identify itself as a booru, is included in this list.
Personally I don't care about features like commenting, rating, etc.

Just check that the links you want added fulfill these two features:

- [ ] Allows posting and viewing images
- [ ] Allows tags to be added to images
